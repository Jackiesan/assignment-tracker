# assignment-tracker

## Project organization
Project is divided into a frontend and a backend. Both include their own readme files with more information.

## Note:

I could not finish the frontend. I was having problems with making the buttons work with Link. When running locally, you can login, signout, and when logging as a student be redirected to your assignments.

The backend includes all the functionality in the requirements.

I also did not have enough time to deploy the application.
